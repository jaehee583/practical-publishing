          <span>Seoul</span> is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom.[7][8] Standing on the
          River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North
          Sea,
          London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans.[9] The City of
          London, London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the
          Square
          Mile − retains boundaries that closely follow its medieval limits.[10][11][12][13][14][note 1] The City of
          Westminster is also an Inner London borough holding city status. London is governed by the Mayor of London and
          the London Assembly.

          <span>Istanbul</span>, formerly known as Byzantium and Constantinople, is the most populous city in Turkey and
          the country's economic, cultural and historic center. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia,
          straddling
          the Bosporus strait (which separates Europe and Asia) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea. Its
          commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives in
          suburbs
          on the Asian side of the Bosporus.[10] With a total population of around fifteen million residents in its
          metropolitan area,[3] Istanbul is one of the world's largest cities, ranking as the world's fifth-largest city
          proper and the largest city in Europe. The city is the administrative centre of the Istanbul Metropolitan
          Municipality (coterminous with Istanbul Province)

          <span>Sicily</span> is the largest island in the Mediterranean Sea and one of the 20 regions of Italy. It is
          one
          of the five Italian autonomous regions and is officially referred to as Regione Siciliana. It has 5 million
          inhabitants.
          The earliest archaeological evidence of human activity on the island dates from as early as 12,000 BC.[6][7]
          By
          around 750 BC, Sicily had three Phoenician and a dozen Greek colonies and it was later the site of the
          Sicilian
          Wars and the Punic Wars. After the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century AD, Sicily was ruled during the
          Early Middle Ages by the Vandals, the Ostrogoths, the Byzantine Empire, and the Emirate of Sicily. The Norman
          conquest of southern Italy led to the creation of the Kingdom of Sicily, which was subsequently ruled by the
          Hohenstaufen, the Capetian House of Anjou, Spain, and the House of Habsburg.

          (official estimate, 1 January 2020) in an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles).[1] Since the 17th
          century, Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science and
          arts. The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has
          an
          estimated official 2020 population of 12,278,210, or about 18 percent of the population of France.[1] The
          Paris
          Region had a GDP of €709 billion ($808 billion) in 2017.[3] According to the Economist Intelligence Unit
          Worldwide Cost of Living Survey in 2018, Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after
          Singapore,
          and ahead of Zürich, Hong Kong, Oslo and Geneva.[4] Another source ranked Paris as most expensive, on a par
          with
          Singapore and Hong Kong, in 2018.
